      "body": "Carvanro is a marketplace where drivers with empty seats meet passengers traveling the same route.\n\nDrivers can save between 50 and 80 % of the cost of driving a car, and passengers can travel in the comfort of a car for the price of a bus.\n\nSharing rides is also fun since you don’t have to travel alone. And last but not least, you make a great effort for the environment."

      "body": "We believe in a trusted community where we aren’t strangers. Therefore, all users have a profile presentation and verified contact information.\n\nDrivers always decide who can join the ride. If there’s any doubts or questions you can chat before sharing you contact information. If you don’t feel safe, just say no.\n\nWe always recommend calling each other to plan the ride. If you feel unsafe after the phone call you can cancel the ride.\n\n[Learn more about safety](en/ridesharing/safety)"
